Description:
        This is a generator which generates an abstract shoreline using perlin noise. There are 3 tiles: water, sand, and grass as well as a rock that user can add to the tile.

Artist Statement:
        I'm trying to create a map that consists of mostly water with sand and grass surrounding it. The water and the sand tiles are supposed to be altered/transformed with the interaction from each other if they come in contact horizontally. I scaled down a few times but I believe I've achieved this goal by having water waves will extend onto sand and sand will extend into water.
